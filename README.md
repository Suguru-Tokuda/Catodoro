## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

Catodoro is built using **MVVM-C** architecture, combining **UIKit** and **SwiftUI** to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. This allows for flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance. Here's a breakdown of the architecture:

- **View**: Built with **UIKit** and **SwiftUI**, ensuring the UI is both functional and beautiful. The cat animations and sounds are integrated to provide an engaging user experience.
- **ViewModel**: Manages the app's business logic, updating the view based on the user's actions and app state.
- **Coordinator**: Handles navigation and flow control between different parts of the app, ensuring a smooth and cohesive user experience.
